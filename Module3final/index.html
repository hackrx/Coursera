                    <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to 
                        animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been 
                        variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, 
                        and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple 
                        of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2] 
                        The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. 
                        In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more 
                        traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more 
                        than two to one.[3]
